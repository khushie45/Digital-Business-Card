# Digital-Business-Card

It's a digital bussiness card based on Scrimba React course. 
This is my first solo React project. 
I built the project based on their Figma file.

How I built it?

1) I built the whole project in Scrimba only in new scrim.
2) Downloaded the zip file of the project
3) Unzipped it.
4) Run the following two commands in the terminal :
  (1) npm install
  (2) npm run build
5) Deleted the node modules folder
6) Deployed it in netlify

You can see the card by visiting the given link. 

Happy coding :)
